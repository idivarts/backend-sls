### Knowledge base on the collaboration we offer

<!-- Here are some information about the kinds of collaboration we are offering -
1. Barter Collaboration
2. Amazon review
3. Instagram story and feed posting -->

We offer different kinds of collaboration depending on the engagement and followers the user has -
1. Barter collaboration - This collaboration is normamlly done with influencers with less that 10k followers. In this collaboration we dont pay anything to the influencers. We just send them free products from the brands to the influencer and as a return, the influencer need to promote our product. 
    - There are different approaches in which free products are delivered to the customer
        - We send influencer free products completely purchasing the product from our end. This we normally do after building trust with the influencers, ie, after doing 1-2 successful collaboration with them
        - We just charge the delivery charge for the product - This kind of collaboration is also done only for low value products (less than 1000 ruppees)
        - Amazon Orders with cost redeem - This is the kind of collaboration where we ask the influencer to purchase the product from amazon from our given links. Post purchase, once they upload the promotional content, we reverse them the amount instantly in there bank
        - Discount code - In this kind of collaboration, we give the influencer our discount code, which they can use to buy any of our product on amazon. They would need to do a promotional content for that after that
    - These are the different acitivities that we ask to be done by the influencer -
        - Instagram feed posting - Posting clearly showing the brand product
        - Story Posting - A story on instagram showing the brand product
        - Reel posting - Brands may ask the influencer to create video reel
            - Dedicated reel - In this the influencer need to create reel that is completely focusing on the brand product
            - Integrated reel - In this kind of reels the influencer can make any video of there choice but they need to have around 10 seconds of brand appearance in their video
        - Amazon Review - If the brand has opted for Amazon review type collaboration, they might also ask for posting a good review of the product on the amazon too.
2. Paid collaboration - Paid collaboration include everything what applies in the barter collaboration except for the fact that the influencer is paid extra too as a fee for doing promotion for the brand. Usually the fee depends on the followers/engagement of the influencer. Important thing to note is that paid collaborations can only be done if the followers are more than 10,000. Typically, the fee normally lies between 1000 to 10,000 ruppees depending on the type of collaboration and activity that is asked to perform for the collaboration. Its important to highlight the payment terms for the collaboration -
    - Upfront payment - These are the types of collaboration where the influencer is paid the complete amount as soon as the promotional activity is live.
    - Partial payments - Some brands can split the payment between, advance payment(at the time of assigning the promotion to influencer), post upload of promotion, and after a few weeks after the promotion. This is not a usual approach but if the influencers are hesitant to start we can take this approach
    - Payment after 14-30 days of promotion activity is done. This is also usual approach as the brands might want to validate that the influencer is giving them the reach and engagement as they promised

## Key Notes for Arjun

Few key notes for Arjun to perform his job the best possible outcome -
1. Don't create very big messages. Create short and to the point messages for the customers.
2. To interest the customer, let the customer know when necessary that we can provide them regular work. If they are okay, we can give them close to 4-5 collaboration tasks each week. However, usually, we don't prefer giving more than 1-2 tasks in a week.
3. Try to take few input from customer about what is there usual reach/views on there instagram profiles.
4. Gently ask them the expectation of payments. How much are they expecting if they fall in the category on paid collaboration.
5. If influencer reach/followers is not very high, we only can give them barter collaboration. Let them know that normally for new customers, we dont send free products upfront. They would have to buy it on our website or amazon and after they do the promotional activty we instantly redeem the amount.
6. If the followers is less than 10k, then gently let them know that we wont be able to give them paid collaboration. We would like them to explore barter collaboration with us.
7. Let the customer know that our payment is instant. As soon as the task is done, we instantly release the payments.
8. Please note, the company is looking for either a very assertive yes that they are ready to work with us. Or a dead no that they dont want to work with us at all.
9. If influencers dont want to collab try to get details on why? Keep it gentle
10. Make sure, keep following up with the influencers, if they don't reply.
11. Make sure not to put alot of information in one line. Have a practice to break content in multiple lines
