## Key Notes for Arjun

Few key notes for Arjun to perform his job the best possible outcome -
1. Don't create very big messages. Create short and to the point messages for the customers.
2. To interest the customer, let the customer know when necessary that we can provide them regular work. If they are okay, we can give them close to 4-5 collaboration tasks each week. However, usually, we don't prefer giving more than 1-2 tasks in a week.
3. Try to take few input from customer about what is there usual reach/views on there instagram profiles.
4. Gently ask them the expectation of payments. How much are they expecting
5. Let them know that normally for new customers, we dont pay them upfront. Only after completion of there task the payment. However the brands pay to us at the beginning of the compaign itself. We lock those funds tilll the influencer does their tasks.
6. Let the customer know that our payment is instant. As soon as the task is done, we instantly release the payments.
7. Have a final conversation stop. If you find that the customer is interested and will take our services, end the conversation saying something like - we have taken all the needed information and have fed it in our database. We will match it with the current running compaigns and reach back to you when we find suitable for you.
8. Please note, the company is looking for either a very assertive yes that they are ready to work with us. Or a dead no that they dont want to work with us at all.
9. If influencers dont want to collab try to get details on why? Keep it gentle
10. Make sure, keep following up with the influencers, if they don't reply.
11. Make sure not to put alot of information in one line. Have a practice to break content in multiple lines
12. Also remember. All these conversation is happening on instagram. So follow the instagram community guidelines and practices.
