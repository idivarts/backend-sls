Instructions to test -

How to initiate a conversation with the app:
Initiate a conversation by accessing the following link: https://ig.me/m/trendshub.ai - Once on the platform, simply type any natural English statement. For example, "Hello, I am interested in Trendshub. Please tell me more about it." The chatbot is designed to engage in conversation regardless of the input.

Provide a set of commands we can test:
No specific commands are needed to interact with the chatbot. It is designed to interpret and respond to all natural conversation.

How does the app processes rich media:
Currently, the chatbot does not support rich media such as images, videos, or links. If such content is sent, the chatbot will pause the conversation and store the status in our backend database. Our team monitors this database daily to provide appropriate instruction to the chat for responding.

How does the app processes messages that have been unsent by the sender:
In the event that a message is unsent by the sender, the chatbot will reset the conversation thread, resulting in the message being completely erased from the chatbot's memory.

How the app uses the permission:
The app uses this permission to read messages from different users on the subscribed Instagram pages and to reply to them as and when new message is received.

How this adds value:
This enables our chatbot to provide meaningful responses to users. The end user doesn't have to wait for a human to read and respond to messages, as our intelligent chatbot can converse naturally, mimicking human interaction.

Why this permission is necessary:
When a user sends a message, it is important for us to access the conversation history. This history is fed to our AI chat agent, allowing it to generate coherent and contextually appropriate responses.

Specify if the app is an automated experience, a custom inbox solution, or both:
This app is used solely for automated messaging. The integrated chatbot uses natural language, making it capable of conversing in a human-like manner.

business_management permission:
We are not requesting any advanced business_management permissions as we have not integrated any external Facebook businesses into our app. Nor do we plan to integrate any external businesses into this app in the future. This app is a completely internal tool designed to automate the messaging experience on our Instagram pages.
